Custom font-awesome icons  

Do not modify any file in /js, they are generated by `node tools/generate-icons.js`. Simply edit SVG files!

Have a look on <https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/advanced/svg-javascript-core>

:warning: SVG file has one constraint : they must contains only one single path element.
